IOT Solution Architecture:

This is our solution Architecture of our prototype, we have divided it into three layers namely Data Acquisition/ Edge Layer, Cloud Layer, Presentatioon Layer.

Data Acquisition Layer:
In the Data Acquisition/ Edge Layer the GPS data ans sensor data is collected by the PLC and are are sent to the Edge device (RaspberryPi), 
using MODBUS protocol. The Acquired data is then processed by our Python Agent and is published to the Cloud (MQTT Broker).   

Cloud Layer:
In the Cloud layer the MQTT subscriber continiously subscribes the topic in which the data is sent. and then the subscribed data is stored in the mongo DB,
and the live data is published via websockt to the presentation layer.

Presentation Layer:
In the Presentation Layer, the live data is displayed, The Presentation layers also allows us to view th history data and Aggregated reports as well.

Hardware Setup
This is the hardware setup of our prototype. here we have the SELEC Twix 2 as the controller(PLC) which collects the sensor data, and some sensors like temprature, etc.,
and the GATEWAY (Raspberry PI) which collects the data from the PLC and sends it to the cloud.

DEMO

For the demo purpose, we have taken one glass of hot water and one glass of ice water(cold water), first we are filling one of the glass with hot water 
in which the temperature sensor is already present, and the live change in temperature is been displayed on the web page and mobile app. when the temperature 
attains the threshold of about greater than 50 C (attains highest threshold), an alert is send to the user as shown, as a next step we are placing our sensor in the cold water. 
And again when the temperature drops below 10 C (attains lowest threshold), an alert is sent to the user as shown. The place of occurance is also plotted on the map. 
This can be viewed on mobile app also.  



Hardware 

1. PLC - 2000
2. Raspberry Pi - 3000
3. sensors - 2000


for the insdustrial standard gateways the cost of the device varies from 10k to 20k based of features live waterprofing IP cetificate.
sensors rates may vary for different purposes.
